# Welcome to your Python Business Challenges

## Overview
Inside each of the folders, there is a text document prompting you with an issue that the Komodo business faces.
With your Python fundamentals, you will be able to complete each of these challenges.

Treat the problems as if they are issues you would be facing at a company you worked at.

Clone this repository, and create Python files inside of each of the challenge directories.
Make sure you create your own challenge repository on GitHub for this folder. The link to that repo is what you will use to submit your finished challenges.
